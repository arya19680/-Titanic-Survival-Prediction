# CODSOFT INTERNSHIP TASKS

## Overview
This repository contains machine learning projects completed as part of the **CodSoft Internship** program. The tasks focus on different predictive modeling challenges, covering essential data science concepts such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Tasks

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Objective:** Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

- **Dataset:** Contains passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and survival status.
- **Techniques Used:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and classification models.
- **Outcome:** A predictive model that estimates survival probability based on passenger attributes.

### 2. Movie Rating Prediction
**Objective:** Predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.

- **Dataset:** Includes historical movie data with various features influencing ratings.
- **Techniques Used:** Regression models, data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- **Outcome:** A machine learning model that estimates user or critic ratings for movies.

### 3. Sales Prediction Using Python
**Objective:** Forecast product sales by analyzing different factors affecting customer purchases.

- **Dataset:** Contains sales data along with advertising expenditures, target audience segmentation, and marketing strategies.
- **Techniques Used:** Time series analysis, regression models, and machine learning algorithms.
- **Outcome:** A predictive model that helps businesses optimize advertising strategies and maximize sales.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development and documentation)
